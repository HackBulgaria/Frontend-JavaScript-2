# Week 2 Data Types & Operations

## Basic Syntax

### Variables

As you know, variables are defined with the `var` keyword.

```javascript
var a = 5;
var b = 6;

console.log(a + b);
```

Variables have types but the types are hidden from us since JavaScript is a dynamic language.

We can have functions, numbers, strings, lists, objects and so on.

```javascript
// numbers
var n = 5;

// strings
var str = "JavaScript is Awesome!";

// arrays / lists
var list = [1,2,3];

// functions
var f = function(x) {
    return x * x;
};

// objects - they serve as dictionaries
var courses = {
    "FrontendJavaScript" : "https://github.com/HackBulgaria/Frontend-JavaScript-1/",
    "Core Java" : "https://github.com/HackBulgaria/Core-Java-1"
};
```

### Function Scope for variables

In languages like C / C++, Java, C#, etc. - we have block scope visibility for variables.

That means, if we create a new variable inside a for-loop, it won't be visible outside it:

```c
for(int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
    // something with i
}

// i is not visible here
printf("%d", i);
```

__In JavaScript, a variable is visible to the enclosing function!__

For example:

```javascript
var arr = [1,2,3];
for(var i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
    console.log(arr[i]);
}

// i is visible
// this will print 3
console.log(i);
```

We have something called __variable hoisting__. All `var` statements are moved to the top of the enclosing function, but the value is assigned later, in the original place of the `var` statement

The code above is translated to:

```javascript
var arr = [1,2,3];
var i; // undefined

for(i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
    console.log(arr[i]);
}

// i is visible
// this will print 3
console.log(i);
```

### Iterating arrays

In JavaScript, we have a standard for-loop:

```javascript
var
    arr = [1,2,3],
    i = 0,
    n = arr.length;

for(i; i < n; i++) {
    // do something with arr[i]
}
```

But also, we have something far more powerful - a [`forEach` method](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/forEach) of the array object:

```javascript
var arr = [1,2,3];

arr.forEach(function(value, index, arr) {
    // do something with value
    console.log(value);
});
```

`forEach` takes a function (__we call this callback__) and calls the given function for every item in the array.

The function is called with 3 arguments:

* `value` - which is the current item in the array
* `index` - which is the index of the current value in the array
* `array` - the array itself.

`forEach` is a method. Since everything in JavaScript is a function, we have methods for most of our types.

### Iterating objects

Objects in JavaScript can serve as dictionaries (hash tables) where the key can be string.
__In JavaScript, objects cannot have keys with different types than a string.__

A fully functioning hash table is coming in the next version of JavaScript.

To iterate an object, we can use a `for .. in` loop:

```javascript
var courses = {
    "FrontendJavaScript" : "https://github.com/HackBulgaria/Frontend-JavaScript-1/",
    "Core Java" : "https://github.com/HackBulgaria/Core-Java-1"
};

for(var course in courses) {
  console.log("A link for " + course + " can be found here - " + courses[course]);
};
```

Later, we will find out that `for .. in` loop goes one step further and returns object properties that we do not want.

Another way to iterate is to use the `Object.keys()` method, which returns all keys from a given object.

For example:

```javascript
var courses = {
    "FrontendJavaScript" : "https://github.com/HackBulgaria/Frontend-JavaScript-1/",
    "Core Java" : "https://github.com/HackBulgaria/Core-Java-1"
};

console.log(Object.keys(courses)); // [ 'FrontendJavaScript', 'Core Java' ]
```

Knowing that arrays have `forEach` method, we can do the following:

```javascript
var courses = {
    "FrontendJavaScript" : "https://github.com/HackBulgaria/Frontend-JavaScript-1/",
    "Core Java" : "https://github.com/HackBulgaria/Core-Java-1"
};

// we can skip the index and array arguments
Object.keys(courses).forEach(function(value) {
    console.log("A link for " + value + " can be found here - " + courses[value])
});
```

## Sorting Arrays

It is a good idea to read the documentation about sort - https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/sort


The default sort sorts the items lexicographically.


Check this out:

```javascript
var scores = [1, 2, 10, 21];
scores.sort(); // [1, 10, 2, 21]
```

If you want to sort numbers, you have to give a comparator function:

```javascript
var numbers = [4, 2, 5, 1, 3];
numbers.sort(function(a, b) {
    return a - b;
});
console.log(numbers);
```
