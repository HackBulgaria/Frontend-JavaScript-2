# Hobby Site Using Bootstrap & Sass

## ULTRA TASK
Recreate 3 site types with 2-3 screens each using bootstrap & SASS

## Premise
- Pick a site type that is related to your hobby - f1, fitness, books, world of warcraft

## Step 1 Brainstorm
- Brainstorm what type of information will be shared there, also in what form
- Do some research check other sites, possible layouts, images you would use, elements you like etc...

## Step 2 Create a mockup
- Create a mockup on a sheet of paper or with a software following this process:
 - What would be the basic layout -> header, sidebar, footer
 - What would be the structure for each page -> list, table, thumbnails, article ...
 - Specify elements -> slider, product info, tabs ...

## Step 3 Identify MVP 
- Identify MVP -> the minimum amount of info, elements and structure in order to present how the ux will look and feel like the final version
 - in a catalogue we only need 2 rows of items
 - product page would have picture on the left, parameters on the right and product info below them

## Step 4 Project Setup (ref previous projects)
- backend (npm) - express, jade
- frontend (bower) - bootstrap, fontawesome
- styles will be in public/css

## Step 5 Create the first screen (index.html)
- include the styles and scripts
- create the layout - header, sidebar ...
- create the content structure - table, grid, thumbnails ...
- create it using bootstrap classes and structure
 - header -> .navbar
 - sidebar -> .nav.nav-stacked
 - grid & structure -> .row and .col-xs-12.col-sm-4.col-md-3 
 - thumnails -> .thumbnail
 - buttons -> .btn.btn-success

## Step 6 Separate the layout from the content
