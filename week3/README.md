# Basic JavaScript OOP & Working with the DOM

Here are two very good guides for starting with JavaScript OOP from the Mozilla Dev Network:

* [Introduction to Object Oriented JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Introduction_to_Object-Oriented_JavaScript)
* [Details of the Object Model in JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Details_of_the_Object_Model)
* [The chapter from Eloquent JavaScript](http://eloquentjavascript.net/06_object.html)
