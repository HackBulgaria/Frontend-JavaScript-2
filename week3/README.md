# Basic JavaScript OOP & Working with the DOM

Here are two very good guides for starting with JavaScript OOP from the Mozilla Dev Network:

* [Introduction to Object Oriented JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Introduction_to_Object-Oriented_JavaScript)
* [Details of the Object Model in JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Details_of_the_Object_Model)
* [What is that object prototype in JavaScript?](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/572897/how-does-javascript-prototype-work)
* [The chapter from Eloquent JavaScript](http://eloquentjavascript.net/06_object.html)
* There are good slides from John Resig for "advanced JavaScript" - http://ejohn.org/apps/learn - you can check it!
* [Example for creating object with JavaScript literal](materials/person.js)
* [Examples for Function.prototype.call and Function.prototype.apply](materials/call_apply.js)
* [Examples for closures](materials/closure.js)
